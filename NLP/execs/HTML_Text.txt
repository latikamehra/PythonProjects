His father served in the army as abomb-disposal expert.[2][3]When he was a child, Greenwood's family would listen to a small number of cassettes in their car, includingMozart's horn concertos, the musicalsFlower Drum SongandMy Fair Lady, and cover versions ofSimon and Garfunkelsongs. When the cassettes were not playing, Greenwood would listen to the noise of the engine and try to recall every detail of the music.[4]He credited his older siblings with exposing him to rock bands such as theBeatandNew Order.[5]The first gig Greenwood attended was theFallon their 1988Frenz Experimenttour, which he found "overwhelming".[5]Greenwood's first instrument was arecordergiven to him at age four or five. He took the instrument seriously, playing it into adulthood,[6]and playedbaroque musicin recorder groups as a teenager.[5]He also learnt theviolaand joined the Thames Valeyouth orchestra, which he described as a formative experience: "I'd been in school orchestras and never seen the point. But in Thames Vale I was suddenly with all these 18-year-olds who could actually play in tune. I remember thinking: 'Ah, that's what an orchestra is supposed to sound like!'"[7]Greenwood also spent time as a childprogramming computers, experimenting withBASICand simplemachine codeto build "rubbishy computer games".[8]According to Greenwood, "the closer I got to the bare bones of the computer, the more exciting I found it".[9]Along with his brother, Greenwood attended the independent boys' schoolAbingdon, where they formed a band, On a Friday, with singerThom Yorke, guitaristEd O'Brien, and drummerPhil Selway.[10]Jonny had previously been in a band called Illiterate Hands with Matt Hawksworth, Simon Newton, Ben Kendrick,Nigel Powelland Yorke's brotherAndy Yorke[11][12]; the last two would go on to form the bandUnbelievable Truth. The youngest member of On a Friday, Greenwood was two school years below Yorke and Colin[13]and the last to join. He first played harmonica and then keyboards, but soon becamelead guitarist.[13]Greenwood studied music atA Level, when he studiedchorale harmonisation.[7]Career[edit]Radiohead[edit]In 1991, Greenwood was three weeks into a degree in music and psychology atOxford Polytechnicwhen On a Friday signed a recording contract withEMI. He dropped out of university and On a Friday changed their name toRadiohead. The band found early success with their 1992 single "Creep". According toRolling Stone, "It was Greenwood's gnashing noise blasts that marked Radiohead as more than just another mopey band ... an early indicator of his crucial role in pushing his band forward."[14]Greenwood wrote his first Radiohead string part for themiddle eightof "My Iron Lung", which appeared on their second album,The Bends(1995).[15]Radiohead's third album,OK Computer(1997), achieved widespread acclaim,[16][17][18]showcasing Greenwood's lead guitar work on songs such as "Paranoid Android".[19]For the track "Climbing up the Walls", Greenwood wrote a part for 16 stringed instruments playingquarter tonesapart, inspired by the Polish composerKrzysztof Penderecki.[20]Greenwood performing with Radiohead in 2006Radiohead's fourth and fifth albums,Kid A(2000) andAmnesiac(2001),recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic change in sound, incorporating influences fromelectronica,classical music,jazzandkrautrock.[21]Greenwood employed amodular synthesiserto build the drum machine rhythm of "Idioteque",[22][23]and playedondes Martenot, an early synthesiser similar to atheremin.[24]He composed a string arrangement for the track "How to Disappear Completely" bymultitrackinghis ondes Martenot playing.[22]According to longtime Radiohead producerNigel Godrich, when the orchestra musicians saw Greenwood's score "they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn't do what he'd written, because it was impossible—or impossible for them, anyway".[25]The orchestra leaderJohn Lubbockencouraged the musicians to experiment and work with Greenwood's "naive" ideas.[26]At the 2005 Ether Festival, Greenwood and Yorke performed "Arpeggi" with theLondon Sinfoniettaorchestra and theArab Orchestra of Nazareth. The song was released in a different arrangement on Radiohead's seventh album,In Rainbows(2007), retitled "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi".[27][28]Radiohead's eighth album,The King of Limbs(2011), was recorded using sampler software written by Greenwood.[8][29]A Moon Shaped Pool, released in May 2016,[30]features strings andchoral vocalsarranged by Greenwood and performed by theLondon Contemporary Orchestra.[31]Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide by 2011.[32]They were inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein March 2019.[33]Solo work[edit]In 2003, Greenwood released his first solo work,Bodysong, the soundtrack for thedocumentary of the same name.The soundtrack incorporates guitar, jazz, and classical music.[25]In March 2004, Greenwood's first work for orchestra,Smear, was premiered by theLondon Sinfonietta. In May, he was appointed composer-in-residence to theBBC Concert Orchestra, for whom he wrote "Popcorn Superhet Receiver" (2005), which won theRadio 3Listeners' Award at the 2006 BBC British Composer Awards.[34]The piece was inspired by radio static and the elaborate, dissonanttone clustersof Penderecki'sThrenody to the Victims of Hiroshima(1960). Greenwood wrote the piece by recording individual tones on viola, then manipulating and overdubbing them inPro Tools.[25]As part of his prize Greenwood received £10,000 from the PRS Foundation towards a commission for a new orchestral work.[35]Greenwood composed thescorefor the 2007 filmThere Will Be Bloodby directorPaul Thomas Anderson. The soundtrack won an award at theCritics' Choice Awardsand the Best Film Score trophy in theEvening Standard British Film Awardsfor 2007.[36]As the soundtrack contains excerpts from "Popcorn Superhet Receiver", an earlier piece, it was ineligible for anAcademy Awardnomination.[37][38]Rolling StonenamedThere Will Be Bloodthe best film of the decade and described the score as "a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be".[39]In 2016, film composerHans Zimmersaid the score was the one that had most "stood out to him" in the past decade, describing it as "recklessly, crazily beautiful".[40]Greenwood performing with theLondon Contemporary Orchestrain Geneva, 2015Greenwood curated a compilation album ofreggaetracks,Jonny Greenwood Is the Controller,released byTrojan Recordsin March 2007.[41]The album features mostly 70srootsand dub tracks from artists includingLee "Scratch" Perry,Joe Gibbs, andLinval Thompson; the title references Thompson's track "Dread Are the Controller".[42]In 2008, Greenwood wrote the title music forAdam Buxton's sketch show pilotmeeBOX.[43]In February 2010, he debuted a new composition, "Doghouse", at the BBC'sMaida Vale Studios. Greenwood wrote the piece in hotels and dressing rooms while on tour with Radiohead.[44]He expanded "Doghouse" into the score for the Japanese filmNorwegian Woodreleased later that year.[44]In 2011, Greenwood scoredWe Need to Talk About Kevin,directed byLynne Ramsay,[45]using instruments including a wire-strung harp.[28]In 2012, he worked with Anderson again, composing the score forThe Master.[46]On 13 March 2012, Greenwood and Polish composerKrzysztof Penderecki, one of Greenwood's greatest influences, released an album comprising Penderecki's 1960s compositionsPolymorphiaandThrenody for the Victims of Hiroshima,Greenwood's "Popcorn Superhet Receiver", and a new work by Greenwood, "48 Responses toPolymorphia".[47]In 2012, Greenwood accepted a three-month residency with theAustralian Chamber Orchestrain Sydney and composed a new piece, "Water".[48]In 2013, Greenwood, Yorke, and other artists contributed music toThe UK Gold, a documentary abouttax avoidancein the UK. The soundtrack was released free in February 2015 through the online audio platformSoundCloud.[49]Greenwood collaborated with Anderson again on the soundtrack for the filmInherent Vice(2014); it features a new version of an unreleased Radiohead song, "Spooks", performed by Greenwood and two members ofSupergrass.[50]In 2014, Greenwood performed with theLondon Contemporary Orchestra, performing selections from his soundtracks alongside new compositions.[51]Greenwood wrote the music for another of Anderson's films,Phantom Thread, in 2017; it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Original Score[52]and earned Greenwood his sixthIvor Novello award.[53]In the same year, he reunited with Ramsay to score her filmYou Were Never Really Here.[54]At the 2019Proms, Greenwood debuted his composition "Horror vacui" for solo violin and 68 string instruments.[55]That September, Greenwood launched a record label, Octatonic Records, to release contemporary classical music by soloists and small groups. Greenwood wrote that he started the label to capture the "remarkable musicians" he had met as a film composer.[56]Collaborations[edit]Greenwood played harmonica onBlind Mr. Jones's 1992 single "Crazy Jazz".[57]For the 1998 filmVelvet Goldmine, he formed Venus in Furs with Radiohead's Thom Yorke,Suede'sBernard Butler, andRoxy Music'sAndy Mackayand recorded covers of the Roxy Music songs "2HB", "Ladytron" and "Bitter-Sweet". Greenwood played harmonica on the tracks "Platform Blues" and "Billie" onPavement'sfinal album,Terror Twilight(1999), produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich.[58]He played guitar onBryan Ferry'salbumsFrantic(2002)[59]andOlympia(2010).[60]In 2004, he and Yorke contributed to theBand Aid 20single "Do They Know It's Christmas?", produced by Godrich.[61]For the 2005 filmHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Greenwood appeared as part of the wizard rock bandWeird Sisterswith Radiohead drummerPhil Selway, formerPulpmembersJarvis CockerandSteve Mackey, electronica artistJason BuckleandAdd N to (X)memberSteven Claydon.[62]In 2008, Greenwood collaborated with Israeli rock musician Dudu Tasa on the Hebrew-language single "What a Day".[63]In 2011, he and Yorke collaborated with rapperMF Doomon the track "Retarded Fren".[64]In 2014, Greenwood performed with Israeli composerShye Ben Tzurand his band. Greenwood described Tzur's music as "quite celebratory, more likegospel musicthan anything—except that it's all done to a backing of Indianharmoniumsand percussion ... I've never performed in this genre before and I certainly don't plan on anything soloistic: I just want to be part of the band and play a supportive role, though I'm not sure exactly what that will be."[65]In 2015, Greenwood, Tzur and Godrich recorded an album,Junun, with a group of Indian musicians atMehrangarh FortinRajasthan, India.[66]The sessions were filmed by Paul Thomas Anderson for hisJunundocumentary,[67]which premièred at the2015 New York Film Festival.[68]In 2016, Greenwood contributed string orchestration toFrank Ocean'salbumsEndless[69]andBlonde.[70]Musicianship[edit]Greenwood is amulti-instrumentalistand plays instruments including guitar, piano, synthesiser, viola, glockenspiel, harmonica, recorder, organ, and banjo.[71]He said in 2014: "I'm always happiest trying new instruments - and honestly enjoy playing, say, the glockenspiel with Radiohead as much as I do the guitar ... I enjoy struggling with instruments I can't really play."[28]Guitar work[edit]Greenwood playingbowed guitarGreenwood has long used a rewiredFender Telecaster PluswithLace Sensorpickups. His other guitars include a mid-seventiesFender Starcasterand aGibson Les Paul.[13][71]He said he dislikes the reputation of guitars as something to be "admired or worshipped", and sees them as a tool like a typewriter or a vacuum cleaner.[28][71]He is known for his aggressive playing style; in the 1990s, he developedrepetitive stress injury, necessitating a brace on his right arm, which he likened to "taping up your fingers before a boxing match".[72]He often useseffect pedals[14]and sometimesplays with a violin bow.[14]In 2010, theNMEnamed Greenwood one of the greatest living guitarists,[73]and he was voted the seventh greatest guitarist of all time in a poll of more than 30,000BBC Radio 6 Musiclisteners.[73]In 2011,Rolling Stoneranked him the 48th greatest guitarist of all time,[14]and in 2012Spinranked him the 29th.[74]In 2008, Greenwood'sguitar soloin "Paranoid Android" was named the 34th best guitar solo byGuitar World.[19]His solos in "Paranoid Android", "Just" and "The Bends" appeared in theNME's 2012 list of the best guitar solos.[75]Ondes martenot[edit]Greenwood performing on anondes martenotGreenwood is a prominent player of theondes martenot, an early electronic instrument played by moving a ring along a wire, creating sounds similar to atheremin.[24]Greenwood became interested in the instrument at the age of 15 after hearingOlivier Messiaen'sTurangalîla Symphony.[2]He said he was partly attracted to the instrument as he cannot sing: "I've always wanted to be able to play an instrument that was like singing, and there's nothing closer."[76]The instrument appears on tracks such as "How to Disappear Completely" (fromKid A) and "Where I End and You Begin" (fromHail to the Thief).[28]As original production of the ondes martenot ceased in 1988, Greenwood had a replica created to take on tour with Radiohead in 2001 for fear of damaging his original model.[24]Other instruments[edit]Greenwood created the rhythm for "Idioteque" (fromKid A) with amodular synthesiser[23]andsampledthe song's four-chord synthesiser phrase from acomputer musicpiece byPaul Lansky.[22]He uses aKaoss Padto manipulate Yorke's vocals during performances of "Everything in its Right Place".[77]In 2014, Greenwood wrote of his fascination with Indian instruments, particularly thetanpura: "Supposedly they're justdronesto accompany singers but in fact they produce a compellingly complex wall of sound, with layer upon layer of drifting harmonics. I've started using some of these instruments in my music because I can't think of any other way, electronics included, of making such sounds."[65]Greenwood has also used a "home-made sound machine", comprising small hammers striking objects including yoghurt cartons, tubs, bells, and tambourines.[78]He has usedfound sounds, using a television and atransistor radioon "Climbing Up the Walls" (fromOK Computer) and "The National Anthem" (fromKid A).[71]Software[edit]At the suggestion of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Greenwood began using the music programming languageMax. He said: "I got to reconnect properly with computers… I didn't have to use someone else's idea of what a delay, or a reverb, or a sequencer should do, or should sound like—I could start from the ground, and think in terms of sound and maths. It was like coming off the rails."[9]Examples of Greenwood's use of Max include the processed piano on theMoon Shaped Pooltrack "Glass Eyes"[79]and his signature "stutter" guitar effect[80]used on tracks such as the 2003 single "Go To Sleep".[81]He also used Max to write the sampling software used to create Radiohead's eighth album,The King of Limbs.[8]Songwriting[edit].mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{margin:0.5em auto 0.8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;font-size:larger;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" “ ";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" ” ";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:360px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{min-width:100%;margin:0 0 0.8em!important;float:none!important}}"People from my background are made to feel that it's wrong to have opinions about classical music ... So I found it quite healthy, particularly at school, to think about classical composers and rock bands in the same way. The reason I loved Messiaen, for instance, was that he was still alive and writing. To me that was as exciting as a great old rock band still being around. Same with Penderecki. His strange orchestral music was quite dark, but it felt similar to the strange electronic music coming out of Manchester."Greenwood on his love of classical and rock music (2010)[7]Greenwood's major writing contributions to Radiohead include"Just"(which Yorke described as "a competition by me and Jonny to get as many chords as possible into a song"); "My Iron Lung" (which Yorke co-wrote with Greenwood[82]) fromThe Bends(1995); "The Tourist" and the "rain down" bridge of "Paranoid Android" fromOK Computer(1997);[13]the vocal melody of "Kid A" fromKid A(2000);[83]and the guitar melody of "A Wolf At The Door" (fromHail To The Thief), whose "sweet" quality inspired Yorke to sing the song's "angry" lyrics.[84]TheNew York Timesdescribed Greenwood as "the guy who can take an abstract Thom Yorke notion and master the tools required to execute it in the real world".[25]Greenwood described his role asarranger:It's not really about can I do my guitar part now, it's more ... what will serve this song best? How do we not mess up this really good song? Part of the problem is Thom will sit at the piano and play a song like "Pyramid Song" and we're going to record it and how do we not make it worse, how do we make it better than him just playing it by himself, which is already usually quite great.[6]For his film soundtracks, Greenwood attempts to keep the instrumentation contemporary to the period of the story; for example, he recorded theNorwegian Woodsoundtrack using a 1960s Japanesenylon-strung guitarand recorded it with period home recording equipment, attempting to create a recording that one of the characters might have made.[28]Many of his compositions aremicrotonal.[28]Influences[edit]Greenwood has cited influences from genres including jazz, classical rock, reggae, hip-hop, and electronic music. His jazz favourites includeLee Morgan,Alice ColtraneandMiles Davis.[77]Along with the other members of Radiohead, he admiresScott Walker,[85]KrautrockbandCan, andSonic Youth.[86][87]Greenwood first heardOlivier Messiaen'sTurangalîla Symphonyat the age of 15 and became "round-the-bend-obsessed with it".[2]Messiaen was Greenwood's "first connection" to classical music, and remains an influence; he said: "He was still alive when I was 15, and for whatever reason I felt I could equate him with my other favourite bands – there was no big posthumous reputation to put me off. So I'm still very fond of writing things in the same modes of limitedtranspositionthat he used."[28]He is an admirer of Polish composerKrzysztof Penderecki, and cited a concert of Penderecki's music in the early 90s as a "conversion experience".[25]He is also a fan ofGyorgy Ligeti,[88]Henri Dutilleux,[89]andSteve Reich. Having performed Reich's compositionElectric Counterpointon guitar,[25]he recorded a version for Reich's 2014 albumRadio Rewrite.[90]Greenwood is a fan of the 80s post-punk bandMagazine. He declined an offer to fill in for guitaristJohn McGeoch, who died in 2004, during the band's 2012 reunion tour. According to Radiohead collaboratorAdam Buxton, "I think Jonny was just overwhelmed, cause he's the biggest Magazine fan in the world. He was just too shy, I think. I'm sure he's got all those licks in his locker."[91]Personal life[edit]Greenwood is married to Israeli visual artist Sharona Katan, whom he met in 1993 when Radiohead performed in Israel.[92]Her work (credited as Shin Katan) appears on the covers of Greenwood'sBodysongandThere Will be Bloodsoundtracks.[93]Their first son, Tamir, was born in 2002; the album Radiohead released the following year,Hail to the Thief, was dedicated to him. Their daughter, Omri, was born in 2005, and a second son, Zohar, was born in February 2008.[citation needed]Katan said she considered themselves a Jewish family: "Our kids are raised as Jews, we have amezuzahin our house, we sometimes haveShabbosdinners, we celebrate Jewish holidays.
